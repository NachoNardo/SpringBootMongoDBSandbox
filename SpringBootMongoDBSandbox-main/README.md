# Spring Boot MongoDB Sandbox

A simple sandbox to play with Java, Spring Boot and MongoDB.

I created a simple API with a few endpoints for testing the conection with MongoDB, and attest its repository reliability.

The project has a pack of collections and a docker-composer for testing purposes that can be found in another repositories in the links bellow.

Feel free to give me sugestions and advices.
